## 🎯 Interests  

- **Open source** – I love contributing and collaborating on projects that empower the community.  
- **Digital painting** – From concept sketches to full‑blown compositions, the canvas is my playground.  
- **Music production** – Beats, synths, and sound design keep the creative engine humming.  
- **AI art** – Experimenting with neural networks to generate surreal visual experiences.
